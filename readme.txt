A helpful Wordpress plugin that automatically adds a helpful popup to any Bible verses you type in your posts that displays the verse.

== Description ==
This plugin introduces support for cross-posting posts from your wordpress site to Medium (https://medium.com), a major American online publishing platform
with many active users.  When you go to publish a post on your site, the post editor will show options for publishing your article to Medium using the Medium 
api.  This allows you to do the work of creating a post once, while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of control posting to your own site grants as well as
the large built-in audience and user recommendation algorithm that Medium provides.  A true win-win!

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
1. Go to the **Plugins** page and activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

First, install and activate the plugin.  Then, sign up for an account with Medium.  Once you are signed up, navigate to your profile, click edit profile,
and go to the "Security and Apps" tab. Scroll until you find the Integration Tokens Section.  Click to create an integration token, name it (the name doesn't
matter too much, just make it something descriptive!), and copy it to your clipboard.  Then, navigate back to your Wordpress Admin.  Find the settings tab for
the plugin, and paste your token into the appropriate field.  Now, you're Wordpress site and Medium Account should be connected for cross-posting.

= What happens if I make a change to the post on my site? =
The plugin will only offer to cross-post to Medium if the post has not been published yet.  So, the change on your site will not be posted to your post
on Medium.  This is due to limitations of the Medium api.  If you want to edit the Medium post, you will have to do so separately from your Medium account.
